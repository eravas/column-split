design notes
- 	left side position (1, 6) and right side position (1, 6) will be used as the side differentiators
	for QMK to tell handedness (row 1, column 6)
-	thumb clusters will be on a hinge and connected to the main board with a molex connector
-	foam layer on the PCB to tune sound profile (more clack or more thock) as needed
-	The Elite-C will be placed towards the "inside", beside the key-matrix on the top side of the PCB, 
	so it will be visible
-	The TRRS jack will not be hidden. Attached to the PCB form the top side.
-	There will be the PCB layer, below the PCB will be the bottom plate, attached with standoffs tall
	enough to clear the hotswap sockets and leave some extra room.
-	Above the PCB layer will be the top plate, on which the switches will be mounted. It will also
	be attached to the PCB with appropriate length standoffs
-	Clear acryllic plate attached with standoffs will cover the Elite-C and TRRS port

->> PROGRESS:
-	Finished PCB designs for left and right sides

->> TODO:
-	top and bottom plate designs for both left and right half
-	thumb cluster - main board hinge design
-	Finalize length for MOLEX cable to connect thumb cluster and main board
